# LoreDump
The place for a story artist to dump their lore.

LoreDump is a collaborative project that was made in a single month between three students learning how to build single-page applications. 

# Description
LoreDump is a Wiki Farm, an application that hosts multiple Wikis (or Worlds as we call it). Users can create their own World and organize their world's Lore into Categories. 

Each world can contain any number of Categories, each containing multiple Lore pages. The Lore pages in turn can have connections to other Lore pages within the same World, providing an easy method of navigating within the World. 

# Future Features
+ User-page for editing user/World settings
+ Allow Worlds to be made visible for everyone
+ Markdown support for Lore page descriptions

# Known Bugs
