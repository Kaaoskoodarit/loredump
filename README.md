# LoreDump
The place for a story artist to dump their lore.

LoreDump is a collaborative project that was made in a single month between three students learning how to build single-page applications. 

# Description
LoreDump is a Wiki Farm, an application that hosts multiple Wikis (or Worlds as we call it). Users can create their own World and organize their world's Lore into Categories.

# Known Bugs
Editing a Lore Page's or a Category's links between one another does not update on the opposite side. Workaround: To add or remove links after creating the Lore / Category, edit the links on both sides to ensure two-sided navigation between pages.
